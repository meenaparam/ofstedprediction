# Predicting Ofsted grades

This repo holds the source code for a simple [R Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) app that estimates the probability of a secondary school being awarded a certain grade after an inspection by the UK school's inspector, [Ofsted](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ofsted).

I built it as my course project for the Developing Data Products course as part of the [Coursera Data Science Specialization in R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science).

The app is hosted here using an AWS Linux server instance: http://www.meenaparam.com/shiny/ofsted-app/

It's very much a work in progress - the predictions could be vastly improved with a bit of fine tuning. But it's a start!

If you want to build your own Shiny app from it, check out the R Shiny website above and my ui.R and server.R files to get started.
