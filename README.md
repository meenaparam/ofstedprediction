# Predicting Ofsted grades

This repo holds the source code for a simple R Shiny app that estimates the probability of a secondary school being awarded a certain grade after an inspection by Ofsted.

I build it as my course project for the Developing Data Products course as part of the Coursera Data Science Specialization.

The app is hosted here: http://www.meenaparam.com/shiny/ofsted-app/

It's very much a work in progress - the predictions could be vastly improved with a bit of fine tuning.

If you want to build your own Shiny app from it, check out the ui.R and server.R files to get started.
